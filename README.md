# Teach-Us-What-You-Know-Video-Project
(Teacher Notes: This project was done after the first quarter of the class. The goal was for students to pick a topic that they were interested in and teach it to the teacher who had no previous knowledge of cyber security. I put numbers in a hat and had students pick topics based on their number so no topics were repeated. I gave them about 5 (1 hour) class periods to work on it, and required periodic updates on their progress. Also I asked them to either send me their video before class or have it ready on a thumb drive)

### Instructions:
Based on what we have learned so far, please pick one of the following topics and create a video and written tutorial, explaining the topic as though your audience has no prior knowledge on the subject (Imagine you are teaching your tutu!).
